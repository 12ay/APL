This assignment you are giving a text file 'puzzle.txt' where each row or column of the text file may contain a word. You are also giving a word file 'wordList.txt' this file will contain the words you need to search for within the puzzle.txt file.  This class project we will create a program that opens up the wordList file to obtain the list of search words and the puzzle.txt file to read in the puzzle. This program will determine which word in wordList is found within the puzzle. Word matches are only limitted to matches found within a column or row. Extra credit will be provided if your program (derived from the class program) can find words within a diagonal.  This project worth 25 points

For 15 of the 25 points:

You must turn in the class project on time, specifying the readMe file and the github link you used (if you are using a different github link). The githhub file must contain the project5 folder. Within the project include the python program the puzzle.txt file and the worldList.txt file. You will it 5 points taken off if these instructions are not followed.

For a maximum of 7 points:

Comment every relevant part of the code: loops, what is being created in the list structures and how is it being created, and what does the function do.

For a maximum of 7 points ( if over 25 points will go to extra credit ):

Write rewrite a section of code in your way that produces the same result. This can be a different function to retrieve the row or column or your own fucntion to find a searched word.


For extra credit : 5 points ( added to other assignments)

Write a routine that can find words from diagonal.

If late, you can get no more that 60% credit and no extra credit. ( just getting 22 out of 25, you only need to fully document the code that will be provided to you, and correctly turn in the project !).


Access to the files and python code can be found at the dropbox link:  https://www.dropbox.com/sh/tdd8roac1fz43pt/AABspj7CYYd4fU-aQKwp46nja?dl=0

The project is due next week Monday ( week 15)
